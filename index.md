        <div id="abs-edutainment" class="abstract" hidden>Information can mobilize collective action against environmental harms, but its impact depends on how it is delivered and by whom. Local leaders can transmit and legitimize new information — or distort and suppress it when incentives misalign. We study these trade-offs in the context of artisanal and small-scale gold mining (<em>galamsey</em>) in Ghana. In a stratified cluster randomized controlled trial across 99 affected communities, we screened a documentary on mercury’s health risks either privately to leaders (traditional local chiefs) or publicly to both leaders and community members. Leader-only screenings produced no health-risk learning among community members and often crowded out their efforts. Public screenings generated strong learning and, only when paired with leaders without conflicts of interest, shifted voting preferences toward stricter community mining rules and mobilized follow-up participation. Where leaders were conflicted, however, public screenings polarized preferences and redirected engagement toward external or digital channels (an NGO-moderated WhatsApp group). Taken together, the results show that robust mobilization of collective action preferences and behaviors requires both an informed public and credible leadership; neither alone is sufficient.</div>

        <div id="abs-india-roads" class="abstract" hidden>Despite a growing literature on the importance of keeping voters informed about politicians' actions, independent and impartial information disclosure systems are exceptions rather than norms in low-capacity states. This research documents the political influence in distorting road quality audits in PMGSY, a nationwide rural road-building program in India. Comparing state-level road quality audit reports around the 2015 Bihar election, I estimate a 7.4 pp reported quality differential by party alignment between legislative constituency and state ruling government (over the sample average satisfactory rate of 64.9%). One-third of the differential can be explained by the assignment of auditors of different leniency. I also find evidence consistent with politicians delaying the inspections of roads of unsatisfactory quality in aligned constituencies until after the election. The same patterns are not observed in the national-level audits, which state-level governments have no control over. The results taken together suggest that out of electoral concerns, the state ruling party manipulates the reporting of audit outcomes, against the hypothesis of resource targeting to improve actual public good provision.</div>

        <div id="abs-digital-payments" class="abstract" hidden>Despite the rapid growth in digital payments (DP) adoption and its positive socio-economic impacts in low-income countries, a large portion of the population remains disconnected from DP. At the same time, usage of DP conditional on adoption is low, highlighting the unexplored potential for financial inclusion and economic advancement. This paper reviews the burgeoning academic literature on DP and categorizes both macro-level adoption barriers (extensive margin) and micro-level usage challenges (intensive margin). We draw on the Transaction Cost Index, a new comprehensive database encompassing 16 low-income countries, to shed light on major themes in markets for DP. We conclude by outlining potential avenues for future research in this area.</div>
